Two different analyses contained here. 
We use the Wu signatures (HSC, GMP, MEP) to produce a heatmap of the pseudo-bulk data. This produces a heatmap with samples as one axis and genes as the other.
Additionally, we produce heatmaps at single cell resolution comparing normal HSC expression of HSC markers from three signatures (Wu, Van Galen, and Eppert) to construct a heatmap with genes as one axis and cells as the other. This constructs one heatmap per patient.
