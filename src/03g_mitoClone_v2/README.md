"01_mitoClone_generateCountTables.R" takes bam and bai files for each single cell as input and constructs count tables, which contain the base counts at each site for each cell. This will be used as input to mitoClone's next steps. We provide count tables as an rds file in CodeOcean, so this step is only necessary if running on a different dataset.
