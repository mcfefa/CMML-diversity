## Pseudo-bulk Analysis

We used to the pseudobulk analysis to see if we would uncover similar patient groups as identified by the projections onto the Palantir normal reference. To do so we converted the single-cell data into a pseudo-bulk aggregation, then clustered and visalized each sample in UMAP space.
