We start with a list of annotated variants which we want to focus on in MAF format ("MAF_all.maf", derived from Eric's annotated csv "tru_variants_scRNA.csv"). This file contains info on the CHROM, symbol, POS (as well as a bunch of other things) for all of the IWG samples. Note that for us, these are GRCh37, not GRCh38.

In addition to this file, we also need: bam and bai files for each sample (maped to GRCh38, VCF files for each sample (GRCh37).

1. The first step is to convert the MAF files to GRCh38. For this we use crossMap. The info for creating a conda environment with this tool is detailed in crossMap.yml. The bash script for converting is given by "convert_maf_toGRCh38.sh"

2. Then, we
